# Benzin

Converts Wii banner layouts and animations to XML and their respective binary format.

- .brlyt to .xmlyt
- .brlan in .xmlan
- .xmlyt to .brlyt
- .xmlan to .brlan

## Changes

This version was modified by WiiDatabase.de so that it can be built with the latest MXML version, update the instructions and the usage information. I claim no copyright on any code.

## Building

- For Linux, install `libxml-dev` (Debian-based: `sudo apt install libmxml-dev`)
- For macOS, install `libxml` with brew: `brew install libxml`
- For Windows, see `Windows-Instructions.txt` (untested)

If you get more errors that are thread related, you may need to add -lpthread to the end of the LIBS line
